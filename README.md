# 👋 Hi, I’m baaaaan1!

## 💻 Software & Hardware Technician
Curious about how things work—whether it’s code or circuits! I’m a passionate technician who bridges the gap between software and hardware, specializing in:

- **C++ with Arduino Framework** for embedded systems
- Building, debugging, and tinkering with all things electronic

## 🌟 Favorite Project
- **Weather Dependent (maybe?)**  
  I love experimenting with projects that respond to the world around us—especially those that bring weather data into the mix!

## 🌱 Fun Fact
Exploring **fesnuk** is more interesting, right?  
(If you know, you know. 😉)
